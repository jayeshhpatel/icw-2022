                                <p><strong>In General:</strong> We do not rent, sell, or share your personal information about with other people or nonaffiliated companies for their direct marketing purposes, except as specifically described in this Privacy Policy. We use third party service providers to perform certain functions or services on our behalf. When we transfer your information, we require all our service providers to maintain the privacy, confidentiality and security of the personal information and data. We take steps to ensure that these third parties take protecting your privacy as seriously as we do.</p>
                                <p><strong>Types of Service Providers:</strong> We engage third parties to perform services on our behalf such as software maintenance services, hosting services, email service providers, database management, web analytics, and other services.</p>
                                <p><strong>Credit Card Processors:</strong> When you enter your credit card information, we transmit your information for processing using secure data transmission services (i.e., credit card information is encrypted). The third-party processor does not store any credit card data associated with any purchases processed on the website.</p>
                                <p><strong>Marketing Support Services:</strong> Like many companies, we contract with third parties to provide customer relationship management (“CRM”) tools for marketing purposes. Typically, these CRM tools are available for our use through a cloud-based platform (such as Salesforce). We engage third parties to provide CRM tools that compile our customer personal information and data that may be collected through various channels, such as, through our Site, telephone, direct mail, and marketing materials.</p>
                                <p><strong>Law Enforcement and Internal Operations:</strong> Personal information may be provided where we are required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that it is reasonably necessary (i) to respond to claims asserted against us or to comply with the legal process (for example, discovery requests, subpoenas or warrants); (ii) to enforce or administer our policies and agreements with users; (iii) for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation, customer support, product development and de-bugging purposes; or (iv) to protect the rights, property or safety of Rip Bull, its users or members of the general public. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise prohibited by law. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to any third-party request to compel disclosure of your information.</p>
                                <p><strong>Affiliates and Business Transfer:</strong> We may share your personal information with our parent, subsidiaries and affiliates. Rip Bull may also sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personal information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. Under such circumstances, Rip Bull will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify its users if their personal information is to be disclosed or transferred and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>

                                <p><strong>Right to Remove or Withdraw Consent:</strong> You have the right to withdraw consent where such consent is required to share or use data, however, you will not be able to opt-out on via the Sites. You may request that we delete your personal information. If you receive communications from us and no longer wish to receive them, please follow the opt out or removal instructions in the email. To delete your account, you must make a request by contacting us. Since your personal information is required for us to provide the Services or to you, deleting it will also terminate your access to the Services. We may be required by law, to retain it to exercise or defend legal claims, or contractual obligations with our customers to retain some information in connection with our obligation to provide the Services. We may de-identify and anonymize some data for purposes of retaining it.</p>
                                <p><strong>Data Portability:</strong> If you would like us to transmit your personal information to another company providing similar services and we are required to so by law, we will work with them to do so upon request and verification of such request with both the requestor and the company receiving the personal information.</p>
                                <p><strong>Right to Redress:</strong> If you are located in the European Economic Area and you believe we have violated any data protection laws, you may file a complaint directly to your local Data Protection Authority (also known as the “DPA”).</p>
                                <p>You may also have the right to make a GDPR complaint to the relevant Supervisory Authority.

If you need further assistance regarding your rights, please contact us using the contact information provided below and we will consider your request in accordance with applicable law. In some cases our ability to uphold these rights for you may depend upon our obligations to process personal information for security, safety, fraud prevention reasons, compliance with regulatory or legal requirements, or because processing is necessary to deliver the Services you have requested. Where this is the case, we will inform you of specific details in response to your request.</p>
                                <p><strong>Communication:</strong> We will provide you reasonable mechanisms to exercise your choice regarding receipt of your personal information from Rip Bull. When you receive an email from us, you may opt-out from receiving future emails from Rip Bull by clicking on the unsubscribe link contained in the e-mail or by contacting us.</p>

To help protect privacy and personal information you transmit through use of our Sites, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We take reasonable and appropriate measures to protect your personal information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction by taking into due account the risks involved in the processing and the nature of the personal data.
